# Come to Papa Moon

> Jack Makled, 2011

a strange piece for Brass Quintet

## Program Notes

I could make up some nonsense about how it exemplifies isolation, or maybe that it's a sketch of some nefarious character. Really, I wrote this as an experiment with random chance and extreme dissonance. The idea was to create a piece with vague instructions on pitching instruments up & down, as I loved the way this vagueness resulted in instruments occasionally "lining up" into some very welcome consonance.

The title is a quote from "The Mighty Boosh" (2004). The troupe's surreal comedy was an inspiration for this piece.

### Composer Notes

Here in the year 2024, I acknowledge this piece is about twice as long as it should be and the de/re-tuning does _not_ need to be happening constantly. I'm "rediscovering" some old pieces I've written, and I might get around to editing this down into something more digestable.

Until then, it exists as a blob of an idea that perhaps someone else might find inspiration in.

## Performance Notes

* The `+/-` cents instructions should be treated as gestures - the specific number isn't as important as the duration & depth of the tuning.
